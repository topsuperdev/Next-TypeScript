# Misc

Scaffolded from NextJS.

## Run

Should be pretty easy. `nvm use; npm i; npm run dev`

## TODO

- Add tests
- Add better loading indicators
- Leverage React context/hooks more efficiently

## HUSKY/PRETTIER/LINT-STAGING

May have to `pre-commit` file executable (via `chmod +x .husky/pre-commit`)
